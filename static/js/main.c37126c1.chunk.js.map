Today, we continue in our tribute to our dear friend, Tammy Plotner, by looking at the spiral galaxy known as Messier 88! During the 18th century, famed French astronomer Charles Messier noticed the presence of several “nebulous objects”  while surveying the night sky. Originally mistaking these objects for comets, he began to catalog them so that others would not make the same mistake. Today, the resulting list (known as the Messier Catalog) includes over 100 objects and is one of the most influential catalogs of Deep Space Objects.'\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nexport default NewsData\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport { Jumbotron,Container, Row, Col, Image, Button,Media } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\nimport './News.css';\r\n// import planet from './assets/planet.jpg';\r\nimport NewsData from './NewsData'\r\n\r\n\r\nclass News extends Component {\r\n  render(){\r\n    const NewsComponents = NewsData.map(comp => <CardNews key={comp.title}\r\n       img={comp.img} title={comp.title} content={comp.content} />)\r\n\r\n    return(\r\n      <Container>\r\n        <Jumbotron>\r\n          <h2>Welcome to Universe Sandbox TM</h2>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <h3>(Not completed) wiki about Universe and science-related stuff.</h3>\r\n           <br/>\r\n          <h4>Quick Info of what you can find here:</h4>\r\n          <h4>Planets Section: Wiki about Universe,Science, Rankings(TOP lists) etc. </h4>\r\n          <h4>SandBox: Not added yet</h4>\r\n          <h4>For more specific info go to the contact section</h4>\r\n          <p>This site is <a>NOT ACTIVE</a> so news wont be updated</p>\r\n        </Jumbotron>\r\n\r\n        <h2> News From Science World </h2>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        {NewsComponents}\r\n      </Container>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction CardNews(props) {\r\n  return(\r\n  <div>\r\n    <Media>\r\n      <img className=\"mr-3\" src={props.img}/>\r\n      <Media.Body>\r\n        <h5>{props.title}</h5>\r\n        <p>{props.content}</p>\r\n      </Media.Body>\r\n    </Media>\r\n    <br/>\r\n  </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default News\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\n\r\nconst SolarSystemData =\r\n  [\r\n\r\n  {\r\n    link:\"/sun-details\",\r\n    img:'http://www.aljanh.net/data/archive/img/981782576.png',\r\n    title:'Sun'\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  {\r\n    link:'/mercury-details',\r\n    img:'http://www.giuseppeveronese.it/public/sitiweb4D/Ardizzon-Sistema-Solare/Mercurio/mercurio.png',\r\n    title:'Mercury'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    link:'/venus-details',\r\n    img:'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Venus_globe_-_transparent_background.png/480px-Venus_globe_-_transparent_background.png',\r\n    title:'Venus'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    link:'/earth-details',\r\n    img:'https://space-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/earth.png',\r\n    title:'Earth'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    link:'/mars-details',\r\n    img:'http://www.wic.ch/IG-Emmen-Im-Wald/Menu_unsere_Taetigkeiten/Planetenweg/bilder/Mars.gif',\r\n    title:'Mars'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    link:'/jupiter-details',\r\n    img:'https://pngimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/planeta-jupiter-png-1.png',\r\n    title:'Jupiter'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    link:'/saturn-details',\r\n    img:'https://space-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/saturn.png',\r\n    title:'Saturn'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    link:'/uranus-details',\r\n    img:'https://png-2.vector.me/files/images/3/0/301806/uranus_thumb',\r\n    title:'Uranus'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    link:'/neptune-details',\r\n    img:'http://clipart-library.com/img1/1553837.png',\r\n    title:'Neptune'\r\n  }\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default SolarSystemData\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\n\r\n\r\nconst StarsRankingsData = [\r\n  {\r\n    title_ranking:\"10.

center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth. It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.\r\n        The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As such, it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to white than yellow). It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.\r\n        The Sun is roughly middle-aged; it has not changed dramatically for more than four billion[a] years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five billion years. It currently fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, converting 4 million tons of matter into energy every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape from its core, is the source of the Suns light and heat. In about 5 billion years, when hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand to eventually become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.\"\r\n\r\n        img_center=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/10572938-3x2-940x627.jpg\"\r\n\r\n        content_center=\"Structure and Fusion:\r\n\r\n        Core – the innermost 20-25% of the Suns radius, where temperature (energies) and pressure are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur. Hydrogen fuses into helium (which cannot currently be fused at this point in the Suns life). The fusion process releases energy, and the helium gradually accumulates to form an inner core of helium within the core itself.\r\n        Radiative zone – Convection cannot occur until much nearer the surface of the Sun. Therefore, between about 20-25% of the radius, and 70% of the radius, there is a radiative zone in which energy transfer occurs by means of radiation (photons) rather than by convection.\r\n        Tachocline – the boundary region between the radiative and convective zones.\r\n        Convective zone – Between about 70% of the Suns radius and a point close to the visible surface, the Sun is cool and diffuse enough for convection to occur, and this becomes the primary means of outward heat transfer, similar to weather cells which form in the earths atmosphere.\r\n        Photosphere – the deepest part of the Sun which we can directly observe with visible light. Because the Sun is a gaseous object, it does not have a clearly-defined surface; its visible parts are usually divided into a photosphere and atmosphere.\r\n        Atmosphere – a gaseous halo surrounding the Sun, comprising the chromosphere, solar transition region, corona and heliosphere.

It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods.\r\n        Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earths orbit as an inferior planet, and never exceeds 28° away from the Sun when viewed from Earth. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western or eastern horizon during the early evening or early morning. At this time it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth, which reoccurs over the so-called synodic period approximately every 116 days.\r\n        Mercury is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, and rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. As seen relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.\r\n        Mercurys axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar Systems planets (about ​1⁄30 degree). Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System;[b] at perihelion, Mercurys distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercurys surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moons, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain\r\n        heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day across the equatorial regions.

Temperatures at the planets centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 °C; 9,300 °F). Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled arcs), which was discovered in 1984, then later confirmed by Voyager 2\"\r\n                                  />\r\n                                  </div>\r\n                                  )}}\r\n\r\nexport  {SunDetails , MercuryDetails , VenusDetails,EarthDetails,MarsDetails,JupiterDetails,SaturnDetails,UranusDetails,NeptuneDetails  }\r\n","import React, {Component} from 'react'\r\nimport {Button,Container} from 'react-bootstrap'\r\nimport './Planets.css'\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport {StarsRankingsData,BlackHolesRankingsData} from './RankingsData'\r\nimport {RankingProps} from './SolarProps'\r\n\r\n\r\nclass StarsRanking extends Component {\r\n  render(){\r\n    const StarsRankingData = StarsRankingsData.map(rank => <RankingProps key={rank.title_ranking}\r\n       title_ranking={rank.title_ranking} img_ranking={rank.img_ranking} content_ranking={rank.content_ranking} />)\r\n\r\n    return(\r\n      StarsRankingData\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass BlackHolesRanking extends Component {\r\n  render(){\r\n    const BlackHolesRankinData = BlackHolesRankingsData.map(rank => <RankingProps key={rank.title_ranking}\r\n       title_ranking={rank.title_ranking} img_ranking={rank.img_ranking} content_ranking={rank.content_ranking} />)\r\n\r\n    return(\r\n      BlackHolesRankinData\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport {StarsRanking,BlackHolesRanking}\r\n","import React, {Component} from 'react'\r\nimport {Container, Jumbotron} from 'react-bootstrap'\r\nimport '../App.css'\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Contact extends Component {\r\n  render(){\r\n    return(\r\n      <React.Fragment>\r\n        <Jumbotron>\r\n          <h1>Contact Section</h1>\r\n        </Jumbotron>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <h2>This is not fully made website-project, The Website is dynamically updated</h2>\r\n        <hr/>\r\n        <div className=\"Contact-Section\">\r\n        <h2>Email: brimstonee12@gmail.com</h2>\r\n        <h2>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Brimstonee12\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/Brimstonee12</a></h2>\r\n        <h4>This Website is made with ReactJS , React-Bootstrap.
