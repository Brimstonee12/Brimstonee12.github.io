      title="Thanks to Gaia, We Now Know Exactly How Big Europa is"
      content_First="Jupiter’s moon Europa continues to be a source of wonder and scientific intrigue. As one of the four Galilean Moons (so-named because of their founder, Galileo Galilee), Europa is one of Jupiter’s largest satellites and is considered one of the best bets for finding extraterrestrial life in the Solar System. And recently, it joined its cousins (Io and Callisto) in passing in front of a star."
      img_First="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/m15-077a.jpg"
      content_Second="This type of rare event (a stellar occultation) allows astronomers to conduct unique observations of a celestial body. In Europa’s case, the occultation took place in 2017 and allowed astronomers to make more precise measurements of Europa’s size, its position relative to Jupiter, and its true shape. All this was made possible by the ESA’s Gaia Observatory, which let astronomers know exactly when and where to look for the moon.
      The study which describes these findings recently appeared in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. The team behind it was led by Dr. Bruno Morgado, a researcher from the National Observatory and the Inter-Institutional of Astronomy Laboratory in Rio de Janeiro, and included astronomers and researchers from Brazil, the United States, France, Venezuela, and Chile.
      In addition to being rare, occultations are extremely valuable to astronomers. Much like when planets transit in front of their host star, stellar occultations enable measurements of the characteristics of the body that is in the foreground (i.e. size, shape, position, etc.) and can reveal if it has an atmosphere, rings, jets emanating from it, and other characteristics."
      img_Second="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/jupiter_moons.jpg"
      content_Third="Thanks to the Gaia mission – which has been measuring the position, motion, and distances of over 1 billion stars since 2013 – astronomers knew exactly when Europa would be passing in experiencing an occultation. The international team was then able to aim ground-based telescopes to the right area of the sky to witness the event. As Dr. Morgado said of the occultation and what it made possible in a recent ESA press release:
      “We used data from Gaia’s first data release to forecast that, from our viewpoint in South America, Europa would pass in front of a bright background star in March 2017 – and to predict the best location from which to observe this occultation. This gave us a wonderful opportunity to explore Europa, as the technique offers an accuracy comparable to that of images obtained by space probes.“
      What they found was that the occultation would be visible from a thick band moving across South America from north-west to south-east. A total of eight observatories attempted to conduct observations of the event, but only three (located in Brazil and Chile) were able to capture data due to poor weather conditions."

      title="Toyota is Building a Pressurized Lunar Rover for Japan"
      content_First="JAXA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is teaming up with the nation’s largest company to build a lunar rover. Toyota, the second largest automobile company in the world (only Volkswagen makes more cars) has signed a development deal with JAXA that will last three years. The goal? To design, build, test and evaluate prototypes for a pressurized, crewed lunar vehicle that runs on fuel-cells."
      img_First="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/001_2-580x326.jpg"
      content_Second="JAXA and Toyota first signaled their intention to work together back in March, 2019. At that time, they envisioned a rover with a remarkable range of 10,000 km (6,200 miles). That’s huge, considering that the Moon’s circumference at the equator is just over 10,900 km (6,773 miles.)
      In March, the pair proposed a vehicle with these properties:
      Length: 6.0 m; width: 5.2 m; height: 3.8 m (19.5 ft; 17 ft; 12.4 ft. About the size of two micro-buses)
      Living space: 13m3 (460 cu. ft.)
      Capable of accommodating two people (four people in an emergency)"
      img_Second="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/20190312_01_03_s-580x326.jpg"
      content_Third="The rover will be an enclosed-body vehicle, rather than an open-body vehicle like the Apollo lunar rovers. Astronauts would be able to remove their spacesuits inside the rover, and live in it for fixed periods of time. They would be able to enter and exit the vehicle easily while wearing spacesuits, and could be controlled remotely, autonomously, or by astronauts themselves.
      Back in March, JAXA President Hiroshi Yamakawa said, “Having Toyota join us in the challenge of international space exploration greatly strengthens our confidence. Manned rovers with pressurized cabins are an element that will play an important role in full-fledged exploration and use of the lunar surface.”"

      title="India’s Chandrayaan-2 is Heading to the Moon"
      content_First="ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) has successfully launched their Chandrayaan-2 mission to the Moon. The mission, which includes an orbiter, a lander, and a rover, was launched into space on a GSLV Mk III rocket on July 22nd, after a week-long delay. On September 7th it will perform a soft-landing on the Moon.
      The Chandrayaan-2 mission, which means ‘moon craft’ in Hindi, is a showcase of Indian technology. The rocket, the orbiter, the lander, and the rover are all products of Indian technological development. In a tweet, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the Chandrayaan-2 mission."
      img_First="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chandrayaan-2-launch.jpg"
      content_Second="Chandrayaan-2 is going to the lunar south pole, a destination no other nation’s spacecraft has reached. Once there, it will investigate lunar water. Though both of the moon’s poles are in shadow, the shadowed area at the south pole is much larger. The mission will study the presence of frozen water in that shadowed region.
      In their press material, ISRO says that the history of the Moon is linked to the history of Earth. In some ways, the Moon is like an undisturbed historical record of the Solar System’s evolution. That historical record is trapped in the frigid, permanently-shadowed areas at the south pole, and the water that’s been frozen there for billions of years."
      img_Second=""
      content_Third="According to measurements taken with NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the temperatures inside permanently-shadowed craters on the Moon’s south pole are the coldest temperatures in the entire Solar System. This frozen water, unchanged since the early days of the Solar System, is of keen interest to scientists for the clues it may hold about the history of the Solar System.
      Frozen water is also of great interest in lunar exploration because it could be used as drinking water, used to grow plants, could provide oxygen for breathing, and could also be used to create rocket fuel.
      The Moon is also an important stepping stone for missions deeper into the Solar System. It’s the perfect test-bed for space-faring technologies."

      title="Crew Dragon Exploded Back in April Because of a Nitrogen Tetroxide Leak"
      content_First="On Saturday, April 20th, 2019, an explosion took place on SpaceX’s Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The company was engaged in a series of static fire engine tests for their Crew Dragon‘s In-Flight Abort test vehicle. This vehicle is essential for crewed missions since it acts as a sort of ejection seat for the crew capsule in the event of an emergency.
      While the initial tests of the twelve Draco thrusters on the vehicle were completed successfully, the initiation of the final test of eight SuperDraco thrusters resulted in the destruction of the vehicle. After a thorough investigation, SpaceX has concluded that the explosion was caused by a nitrogen tetroxide leak that occurred just prior to the final test.
      Following the accident, and in accordance with pre-established safety protocols, the team worked with the US Air Force (USAF) to clear the test area of debris and collect and clean samples for the investigation. They monitored the local winds and other factors to make sure there was no threat to the health and safety of the public."
      img_First="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12376190_10156964768585131_5608307214953753704_n.jpg"
      content_Second="SpaceX then convened an Accident Investigation Team that included officials from the NASA, and observers from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Together, they developed a fault tree and began to systematically investigate the probable cause.
      Their initial finds indicated that the anomaly occurred approximately 100 milliseconds prior to the ignition of the SuperDraco thrusters and during the pressurization of the vehicle’s propulsion systems. They also determined that a leaking component allowed nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) – a liquid oxidizer – to enter the capsule’s high-pressure helium tubes while it was still undergoing ground processing.
      During the rapid initialization of the launch escape system, a slug of NTO was then driven through a helium check valve at high speed, resulting in structural failure within the check valve. To recreate the exact scenario, the accident investigation team used debris collected from the site (which identified where burning took place within the check valve) to conduct a series of tests the SpaceX rocket development facility in McGregor, Texas."
      img_Second="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ripley_Crew_Dragon_Demo1.jpg"
      content_Third="Nevertheless, the static fire test and anomaly provided a wealth of data. In addition, the SuperDraco thrusters were recovered from the test site intact, which is a testament to their reliability. As such, SpaceX fully intends to take the lessons learned here and use them to inform future missions, as well as further improvements in the safety and reliability of its flight vehicles.
      Already, SpaceX has taken measures to ensure something like this doesn’t happen again. This includes eliminating any flow path within the launch escape system to ensure that liquid propellant cannot enter the gaseous pressurization system. They’ve also taken to using burnt discs instead of check valves, which remain completely sealed until opened by high pressure – instead of allowing liquid to flow in only one direction.
      SpaceX has begun testing and analyzing these mitigation methods with NASA already and indicated that they will be completed well in advance of future flights. The company has also shifted spacecraft assignments forward to remain on track for Commercial Crew Program flights.
      These include the second demonstration mission (Demo-2) to the ISS, which will be flown using the Crew Dragon originally intended to fly the first operational mission (Crew-1). It’s also worth noting that SpaceX’s facility at Cape Canaveral was operational in time for the launch of a Falcon Heavy rocket, as part of Space Test Program-2 (STP-2), and the landing of its two first-stage side boosters on June 25th, 2019."

     title="First Ever Image of Quantum Entanglement"
     content_First="During the 1930s, venerable theoretical physicist Albert Einstein returned to the field of quantum mechanics, which his theories of relativity helped to create. Hoping to develop a more complete theory of how particles behave, Einstein was instead horrified by the prospect of quantum entanglement – something he described as “spooky action at a distance”.
     Despite Einstein’s misgivings, quantum entanglement has gone on to become an accepted part of quantum mechanics. And now, for the first time ever, a team of physicists from the University of Glasgow took an image of a form of quantum entanglement (aka. Bell entanglement) at work. In so doing, they managed to capture the first piece of visual evidence of a phenomenon that baffled even Einstein himself.
     The paper that described their findings, titled “Imaging Bell-type nonlocal behavior“, recently appeared in the journal Science Advances. The study was led by Dr. Paul-Antoine Moreau, a Leverhulme Early Career Fellow at the University of Glasgow, and included multiple researchers from Glasgow’s School of Physics & Astronomy."
     img_First="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dims.jpg"
     content_Second="Quantum entanglement describes the phenomenon where two particles which interact with each other can remain connected, instantaneously sharing their physical states no matter how far apart they are. This connection is at the heart of quantum mechanics, even though it violates the concept of local realism and many elements of Special Relativity.
    By 1964, Sir John Bell expanded on the work of previous theorists by formalizing the concept of nonlocal interaction and describing a strong form of entanglement. This would come to be known as Bell entanglement, a concept that is being harnessed for multiple scientific applications – like quantum computing and cryptography.
    And yet, until now, it was never captured in a single image. As Dr. Moreau said in a University of Glasgow press release:
    “The image we’ve managed to capture is an elegant demonstration of a fundamental property of nature, seen for the very first time in the form of an image. It’s an exciting result which could be used to advance the emerging field of quantum computing and lead to new types of imaging.”
    For the sake of their study, the research team devised a system where a stream of entangled photos are fired from a quantum source of light. This stream then passes through a series of “non-conventional objects”, which refers to liquid-crystals materials which change the phase of the photons as they pass through."
     img_Second="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/quantum-540x380.jpg"
     content_Third="The setup also included a super-sensitive camera capable of detecting single photons and capturing images of them. However, the camera was programmed to only take pictures if it caught sight of both one photon and its entangled twin. In so doing, the experiment effectively created a visible record of the entanglement of two photons.
     The results of this study open the door to a whole new world of quantum imaging techniques that take advantage of Bell entanglements. It also has implications in the field of quantum information (i.e. quantum computing and cryptology)"

     title="Pictures from Curiosity Show the Bottom of an Ancient Lake on Mars, the Perfect Place to Search for Evidence of Past Life"
     content_First="In a way, Mars looks like a dusty, dead, dry, boring planet. But science says otherwise. Science says that Mars used to be wet and warm, with an atmosphere. And science says that it was wet and warm for billions of years, easily long enough for life to appear and develop.
     But we still don’t know for sure if any life did happen there.
     The scientific effort to understand Mars and its ancient habitability has really ramped up in recent years. Now that Spirit and Opportunity are gone, MSL Curiosity is carrying the workload. (NASA’s InSight lander is on Mars too, but it’s not looking for evidence of life or habitability.)"
     img_First="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pia19839-galecrater-main-a.png"
     content_Second="Christopher House is a Professor of Geosciences at Penn State University. He’s also a participating scientist with NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory mission. In a press release from Penn State University, House talked about the MSL mission and what it’s like to be involved on a daily basis with the ground-breaking mission.
     “Gale Crater appears to have been a lake environment,” House said, adding that the mission has found a lot of finely layered mudstone in the crater. “The water would have persisted for a million years or more.”"
     img_Second=""
     content_Third="Gale Crater was chosen as the target for Curiosity because it’s a complex place. Not only was it a lake bed, meaning there are minerals there that can yield clues to Martian habitability, but that lake was eventually filled with sediment. That sediment turned to stone, which then eroded. That same process is what created Mt. Sharp, the mountain in the middle of Gale Crater, and another of Curiosity’s objects of fascination.
     “But the whole system, including the groundwater that ran through it, lasted much longer, perhaps even a billion or more years,” he said. “There are fractures filled with sulfate, which indicates that water ran through these rocks much later, after the planet was no longer forming lakes.”"
