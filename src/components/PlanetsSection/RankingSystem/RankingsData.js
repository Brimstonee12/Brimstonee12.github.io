It is located in the constellation of Gemini, 34 light years from Earth.It is orbited by a planet named Thestias- twice as big as Jupiter. Its radius is 8.8 times bigger than Suns, though its mass is shy of two times bigger than our stars."

It’s mass is only 1.08 times bigger than Suns, which means is lighter than Pollux, but its radius is 25.5 times larger. Arcturus is located in the constellation of Bootes and it is the fourth brightest star in the night sky (170 times more luminous than Sun)"

It will probably explode as a supernova in next million years, though now it’s radius is 877 times larger than Sun’s and it is 11 times more massive. Betelgeuse is a single isolated star, though there were two spectroscopic supergiants proposed as the companions."

It is located in the constellation of Cepheus, 5000 light years from Earth . VV Cephei is a shell star, which means its spectrum shows extremely broad absorption lines, it is also a B[e] type star, which means that it has forbidden neutral and low ionisation emission lines in its spectrum."

The radius is about 1420 times larger than Sun’s and it is 17 times more massive. In 2009 study of Nathan Smith from University of California confirmed that both Betelgeuse and VY Canis Majoris can explode as supernovas any time, though some argue that it will happen no sooner than in 100,000 years."

    title_ranking:"1.UY Scuti",
    img_ranking:"https://i.imgur.com/xClsakh.jpg",
    content_ranking:"And finally, the largest star in the universe discovered so far is UY Scuti. It was first discovered in the 19th century by a team of German astronomers at the Bonn Observatory, Germany. At that time the star was named BD -12 5055. Located in the constellation of Scutum, it’s currently the largest star known to us. According to estimations, UY Scuti has a radius of 1,708 solar radius and thus 5 billion times bigger than the Sun. Just for the sake of simplicity, based on the above numbers if this supergiant is somehow placed at the center of our solar system, then its outer atmosphere would most probably engulf the orbit of Saturn. The current stellar model suggests that it will explode to form a supernova before evolving into a yellow giant or a Wolf-Rayet star."
